# Introduction
^^^I'm using markdown language instead of HTML to make headers, manipulate texts, and add images. Go to [this GitHub link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for help with markdown (md) language.

Here, I'm going to talk a little about the purpose of this site. If you're not sure **why** you're doing this project, be sure to read the **Context and Purpose** section of the prompt. 

# Why Aldus Manutius? 

Here, I'm going answer why I've selected this particular print for my project. It might also be a good place to include an image or a sample of the text at hand. 

![Aldus Manutius in his print shop](aldus.JPG)
^^^This image is right out of Howard's book. It's not really available for free online. To avoid copyright infringement, I've cropped quite a bit of it (plus we're not selling this image and we're using it for educational purposes, so it should be fine). If you can't find an image online or you need to use an image of your own making, the easiest thing to do is to upload it as a file to your repository. Then use the following to include your image: exclamation mark, brackets including the name of your image, followed by parentheses including the URL or just the file name, e.g. file.JPG. So it will look like this: ![image name](name.JPG)




# Historical Context 

In this section, I'm writing about Manutius (perhaps a very short bio) and the European context in which he was working. Most likely, I'll have several quotes from Howard, and I might even use the Seattle University library to find an additional article about him. Because this is going to be a public document, I'll avoid non-scholarly sources like Wikipedia. Although, Wikipedia can be a great place to find articles (see the References section of any entry). 

# The Adaptation

Here, I'm going to spend some time walking the audience through my adaptation. Think about all the analyses you've conducted this term. Most of them have been split in half. You've looked at the **formal qualities** as well as the **cultural significance** of these texts. I'm going to use an h2 (##) heading to divide this section. 

## Formal Qualities

I might consider the grid of my image, the layout, hierarchy, or even the typeface. Go back through your slack posts and select the formal aspects of the image that you deem to be most important. I would seleect at least 2-3 formal qualities. It might be helpful to compare and contrast your adaptation to the original. 





You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/aaronottinger/hott.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/aaronottinger/hott.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
